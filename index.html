            <h1>Semantic HTML Elements Reference Table</h1>
            <p>Opting for semantic HTML elements can be a valuable strategy to maintain site 
                accessibility, optimize for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and enhance 
                code comprehensibility. When utilizing semantic HTML elements, your choices are 
                driven by their meanings. However, elements like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; 
                aren't considered semantic because they lack contextual information about 
                their enclosed content. Recognizing the significance of this topic, I chose to 
                create a Semantic HTML Elements Reference Table as a practical exercise presented 
                by <a href= "https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> in the <em>Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet</em>.
